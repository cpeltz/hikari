Hikari means light (e.g. from the sun, not the opposite of heavy) and is a image
tagging and viewing program. What does this mean? First, you can browse your
images with this application, Second, you can assign informativ tags to the
images, like nature or home. If you look for a specific bunch of images you can
search for these tags and will auomatically get all images on your disc that
contain such a tag.

Design-thoughts:
The tags won't be saved inside the images rather than externally in a global
file, this file contains for each image tagged a line consisting of (path to
file, SHA-256 or SHA-512 hash sum, list of tags). If a file once tagged is moved
to a other location and the user starts the program (alternativ when try to view
the moved file) a notification will be displayed and the program may search (or
the user specifies a folder or the user does not want it or the image was
removed) for the missing file using the hash sum (maybe a hint of the user would
be nice, where the file may be located).
As this program may be used to just view and browse images it should be fast to
start and appear (extra Threads for reading tag-file etc). The interface should
be clean and simple at first, only if the user wants to use the advanced
features (user-configuration) the interface will be expanded (maybe fast toggle
button).
Middle-Mouse Button action configurable (scroll or zoom or go to next/prev).

Used tools:
cmake
git
g++

Used Librarys:
boost
ossp-uuid
crypt++

Librarys maybe used in the future:
gtkmm
glademm
(what about image handling? magick++?)
sqlite3
